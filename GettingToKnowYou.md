# Getting to Know You

## What are you interested in and why?
Above all, I love logic. That love cascades down into all sorts of disciplines, such as math and computer science. There's something magical in the way simple axioms can be used to build complex theorems and ones and zeroes can be arranged to create the Internet. I also like applying logic in unconventional circumstances, such as clear and structured writing.

## What do you consider to be your personal strengths? Explain.
My greatest strength is my willingness to learn. I learn quickly and I learn well. I am skilled at making connections between new information and existing knowledge. My goal in life is to learn everything I possibly can.

## What do you consider your personal weaknesses? Explain.
I am... less than practical at times. Take right now, for instance: I'm typing the answers to these questions in an experimental text editor, using a file format called Markdown, and saving my work to GitHub. I have a tendency to get something in my head and refuse to change my methods, even if I'm obviously making unnecessary work for myself.

## Is there anything you would like to share about your family that would help me know you better?
I consider myself the most frugal member of my family, although that may be because I'm working with very small sums of money. I'm the first STEM-oriented person in my family, so I've never had a whole lot of help with math or science. The humanities are another story. My father taught theater history and writing at CSULB and my mother has a film degree from USC. They've given me such fantastic help with writing.

## Have there been any outside circumstances that have kept you from doing your best work? Explain.
I wouldn't say so. I've been rather fortunate in my life.

## Please describe any special needs you have that may affect your college selection.
I'll admit, I got a little overwhelmed by the sheer number of available colleges, so I might have latched on to Harvey Mudd as a nearby goal that I don't really have to think about. But then again, it's a wonderful school that focuses on STEM without abandoning the humanities. I've also been in regular contact with the cross country coach. A strong running program is definitely one of my considerations.

## Describe an event/situation that has had a major impact on you. Give details and examples.
Every summer, Coach Fillipow takes 32 runners up to Mammoth Lakes for a 9-day training camp. My three trips up to Mammoth have taught me more about life in general than school ever could. Sharing a condo with seven other boys is a difficult experience and has forced me to become more comfortable with resolving differences with others. Running on backcountry trails in the fresh mountain air has fostered my love of nature. I've even learned mundane tasks up in Mammoth, such as how to use a washing machine and a dishwasher, giving me a greater sense of independence and preparing me for life beyond high school and college.

### Highest level of education of your father: Graduate degree

## Do your grades reflect your ability?
I sure hope so!
